# How to install  
  
### `Installing packages:`
- First, clone the repository to your machine
- After cloning the repository, open the terminal inside the cloned repository directory and type:
```
  npm install
```  
- Or
```
  yarn install
```  
  
### `Run/install back-end server:`
- The app uses the [@json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) library, which is a pre-made backend server with several functions like CRUD, keeping data on a .json file and search function
- The library needs a dependency that somehow is not installed together:
```
  npm install scheduler
```
- Or
```
  yarn install scheduler
```

- After installing this second dependency, you just have to run the back-end server:
```
  npm run dev:server
```
- Or
```
  yarn dev:server
```
  
### `Run the app:`
- Now you gotta just run the front-end app...
```
  npm run dev
```
- Or
```
  yarn dev
```
